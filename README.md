PyTorch implementation of the Simple Permutation-Invariant Graph Convolutional Network (SPI-GCN)

To be able to run our code, you need to install the following dependencies:
- networkx: a Python package for graph manipulation. Needed in particular to convert the benchmark graph data sets
  to the appropriate format for our algorithm
- pymatgen: a Python package for materials science. Needed to be able to test SPI-GCN on the HYDRIDES data set
  of metal hydrides (convert chemical data from POSCAR format to graph format)
